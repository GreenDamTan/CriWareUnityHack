# Something Is Missing

Yahaha! You found me!

The core code can be found at [`app/src/main/cpp`](app/src/main/cpp). To build this project, you should use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).

Default setup:

- Android SDK version 23 (Android 6.0)
- Build Tools 28.0.1
- NDK r12b+

If you don't have the tools of exactly these versions, you can edit `app/build.gradle` to adapt to your local environment. For NDK, it is always safe to use the latest versio.

Please follow the license.
